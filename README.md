# StarBase

April 2025: 

**Development has moved to [ewowi/MoonBase](https://github.com/ewowi/MoonBase)**. 
**See [Star-Mod-Base-Light-Moon-Svelte-Live](https://moonmodules.org/Star-Mod-Base-Light-Moon-Svelte-Live)**

Januari 2025: 

* StarBase and StarLight will change to "StarLight as a service", meaning UI, Network, File, Web modules will be stripped from it. Currently this is done in the [StarAsAService](https://github.com/MoonModules/StarLight/tree/StarAsAService) branch
* A new repo [MoonLight](https://github.com/MoonModules/MoonLight) has been created, which is a fork of [ESP32-sveltekit](https://github.com/theelims/ESP32-sveltekit) and uses StarAsAService as a library. By this we combine the beauty of it's UI, and the power of its server with the Fixture, Effects and Projections functionality of StarLight.
* See [MoonLight Project](https://github.com/users/ewowi/projects/2) for our project KanBan board.
* Developers wanted, both UI and Server side, please contact us on [Discord/moonlight](https://discord.gg/TC8NSUSCdV)
